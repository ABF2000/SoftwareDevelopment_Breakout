# SoftwareDevelopment_Breakout
 C# implementation of the arcade game "Breakout"

 "Breakout" contains all the code relevant to the actual game including the underlying 2d engine, score system, player-controller and more.
 "BreakoutTests" is a complementary foler containing test files for edge-cases and other features that might be influenced with further changes to the project.
